tell me the function of the project like what feature does it has what can it do

Below is a clear, defense-ready explanation of what your E-Commerce Simulation project does and what features it has, written in a way you can say to the lecturer or put in your README / report.

1. Project Overview (What is this system?)

This project is a Web-based E-Commerce Simulation System modeled after Shopee/Lazada.

It simulates:

How an online marketplace manages products, orders, vouchers, and inventory

How the system handles thousands of concurrent requests (flash sale)

How legacy business data (CSV) is migrated into a modern database

How managers monitor business activity via dashboards

The system is built using Java Web (Servlet/JSP) running on Apache Tomcat, with a local MySQL database.
